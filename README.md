# GPTsMotion AI: Full Browser Automation


GPTsMotion uses GPT-4 to control your browser and perform repetitive actions on your behalf. Currently it allows you to define ad-hoc instructions. In the future it will also support saved and scheduled workflows.

GPTsMotion is fully open-source, and we don't send any page contents or instructions to our servers.
